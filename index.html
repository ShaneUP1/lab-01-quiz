            <h1>Welcome to Shane's Life in a Page</h1>
            <p> Shane was born in June of 1983 which makes him 37 years old today. The first 10 years of life were spent in Florida where he made many trips to Disney World.  
                When he was 10 he and his family moved back to Georgia where he was originally born. He graduated Georgia Tech with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and then quickly
                got a job with a racecar team out of Louisville Kentucky, where he served as Team Engineer.
                <br>After some years pursuing a career in auto-racing he decided it wasn't how he wanted to spend his time on Earth and he got out. With no real idea of what was next
                he took a few Engineering'ish jobs to pay bills and then eventually moved out West to Boulder, CO.  There he pursued a career as a CrossFit Coach at a successful gym, 
                CrossFit Roots. He also met his wife there. After 8 years they decided it was time to move on to new places and ended up in Portland, OR.
                <br>In Portland he opened his own CrossFit gym, CrossFit Modern Monkey, and had a pretty successful first year. He hit all of his business plan milestones and things 
                were beginning to look stable for his gym. Then came the novel coronavirus that turned the entire world on its head. After several months of being ordered closed, he 
                had no other option but to close the doors and figure out what his next move would be.
                <br>He had a couple of friends that had recently switched to careers in coding and the idea intrigued him though he had very very little previous experience. After some
                 searching on the web for a program he came across Alchemy Code Labs, a program that up until then had always been an in-person program but due to 'rona', had just begun 
                 having classes live-online.
                <br>He had an interview with Megan, who was awesome and said all the things he needed to hear, and made the decision to make the jump. He now resides with his wife and 1 
                year old in Texas, with his in-laws who are helpig with childcare so he can focus on the Alchemy program.
